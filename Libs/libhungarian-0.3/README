This package contains a C implementation of Harold Kuhn's well-known
Hungarian Method for solving Optimal Assignment Problems.  The running time
for this algorithm on an mXn problem is O(m*n^2), which correlates well
with my own experience with this implementation.

The API is straightforward; see test.c for an example.

NOTE: 
  hungarian_solve() seems to hang on certain extreme (degenerate?) inputs, 
  especially when the rating matrix is non-square.  I don't what's causing
  this problem.

PYTHON NOTE:
  python bindings now in python/ directory. The makefile has two targets, one
  being "python" and the other "pyinstall" which should build, or build and
  install the "hungarian.so" bindings in your local site-packages directory.
