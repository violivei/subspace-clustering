##Subspace Clustering with Self-Organizing Maps

Subspace clustering is the task of identifying clusters in subspaces of the input dimensions of a given dataset. Noisy data in certain attributes cause difficulties for traditional clustering algorithms, because the high discrepancies within them can make objects appear too different to be grouped in the same cluster. This requires methods specially designed for subspace clustering.

##Local Adaptive Receptive Field Dimension Selective Self-Organizing Maps - LARFDSSOM

LARFDSSOM is a time-variant topology Self-Organizing Map (SOM) that improves over DSSOM (see below) in terms of clustering quality, computational cost and parameterization. This enables the method to identify the correct number of clusters and their respective relevant dimensions, and it thus presents nearly perfect results in synthetic datasets and surpasses our previous method in most of the real world datasets considered.

##Datasets

Details of the data mining datasets. The n; d; k; r refer to the number of data
points, the number of attributes, the number of clusters, and the application context,
respectively

Face clustering problem consists of clustering images accordingly, to identify
individuals. The experiments are performed on the Yale faces B
database (http://cvc.yale.edu/projects/yalefacesB/yalefacesB.html).
